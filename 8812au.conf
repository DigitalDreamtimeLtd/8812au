# /etc/modprobe.d/8812au.conf
#
# Purpose: Turn on USB3 support
#
# Place this file in /etc/modprobe.d
#
options 8812au rtw_switch_usb_mode=1
#
# Note: The driver is supposed to come up and start in
# USB 2 mode and switch up... but it doesn't.
#
# (USB 2 bandwidth is only 480Mbps thus limiting throughput to around 240Mbps)
